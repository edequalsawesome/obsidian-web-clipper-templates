# Obsidian Web Clipper Templates
Templates for the Obsidian Web Clipper that I made. They're probably really only things that I might need, but hey, if they help you, too, have at 'em, bud.

To install templates, see instructions in the official [Obsidian Web Clipper documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/web-clipper/templates) repo.
